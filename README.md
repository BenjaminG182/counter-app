Hello!

This is a simple javscript/html/css application that increments, saves, and displays a number. 

The idea behind it is that it is counting people entering a subway. You click "INCREMENT" each time someone comes in, and save when you want to save everything. The save will display below, and next time you click increment, the increment has reset to zero.
